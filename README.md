# Kernel Exploitation
I will present the first steps I learned in the operating system kernel exploitation- linux, what can be done, how to do it, and especially the basics that will open the kernel login gateway.This article is not about researching/exploiting weaknesses in the operating system but rather exploiting weaknesses that occure when we run in Kernel mode. In the field of binary exploitation, or know and understand the following:

* linux 
* kernel modules 
* C and Assembly 
* buffer overflow 

Kernel Mode can run 2 types of code: 
- Kernel code in the container operating system--The basic parts of the system run including memory manager, process manager, file system, etc.
- Kernel modules: It is a code that can be written, compiled, and loaded(You can also release/delete it from the system) Into the operating system as an "add-on" to the kernel with the rise of the computer (running code in Mode Kernel.) It is important to emphasize that the Module Kernel is not part of the original operating system kernel and does not come as part of the installation

So, if we want to look for operating system kernel weaknesses and we can look for weaknesses in kernel modules loaded to kernel and running in kernel. When dealing with programs running in User mode our input will usually come through the stdin (sometimes from files or possibly from the network in order to disrupt the program run we will need to input no Legitimate (too long/too short/unreadable characters, etc...). 


Now we want to send an input or change some value in a file/data structure so that we enter our input to the kernel. In fact, we want some function that you want in Mode Kernel to use the values we control in them. If the kernel has a function that works with strings, we want to send it a string. 
we can actually run a kernel function with data we control in User Mode. If, for example, a call system with a chance of overflow buffer is found, we can call a call system with a parameter like a very long string. Once we understand what code is running in the kernel, where it comes from, how we can run the code then it's time to try and exploit a vulnerable code running in the kernel. We will write a vulnerable kernel module, load it into a kernel, and try to exploit the weakness.
